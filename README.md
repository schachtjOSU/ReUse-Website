## Client Purpose
In early 2010, we created the Corvallis-Area ReUse Directory, a guide to all of the organizations and businesses in Corvallis and Philomath that accept items for reuse. The guide is categorized into types of items and a corresponding list of locations that accept said items.

## Project Goals

To take the current state of the project from development to production.

Finalize an administration portal where entries can be added, removed, and customized.

Develop both an iOS and android applications used primarily for viewing existing data, **serving as a more user-friendly reuse-directory**

Bring the managing API to a production-ready state
