#The Corvallis Reuse and Repair Directory

## Project History
In early 2010, the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition created the Corvallis-Area ReUse Directory. The purpose of the Corvallis Reuse and Repair Directory, (Corvallis ReUse), is to provide Corvallis and the outlying community a way to easily locate organizations that will take items for repair, reusable items that can be sold to the public as used items, and items to recycle. You can <a href="http://sustainablecorvallis.org/action-teams/waste-prevention/corvallis-area-reuse-directory">download the current directory</a> from the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition website.

##The Corvallis Reuse and Repair Website
The Corvallis Reuse and Repair website was created to serve as a user-friendly alternative to the PDF directory. Working with Oregon State University students, the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition has released <a href="http://app.sustainablecorvallis.org/">the Corvallis Reuse and Repair Directory</a> website, as well and an Android app.
