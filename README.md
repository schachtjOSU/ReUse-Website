## Main Site:
http://sustainablecorvallis.org/action-teams/waste-prevention/corvallis-area-reuse-directory

## Client Purpose
In early 2010, we created the Corvallis-Area ReUse Directory, a guide to all of the organizations and businesses in Corvallis and Philomath that accept items for reuse. The guide is categorized into types of items and a corresponding list of locations that accept said items.

## OLD_ADMIN branch

Old version of the Administration Site with a more traditional layout.
During the development process this site was updated to include additional functionality as requested by the client.
However, this site is not fully functional or secure at the moment.
